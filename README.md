## LeetCode Rating Predictor

This project was built for LeetCode contestants to view their rating changes right after a contest ends. The official site takes a few days to declare contest results, so you can get an idea of your performance here before that. Head over to this [link]( http://NUMBART.github.io/leetcode-predictor-frontend) to view your changes for the latest contest.
