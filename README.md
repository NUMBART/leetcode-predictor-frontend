## LeetCode Rating Predictor

This project was built for LeetCode contestants to view their rating changes right after a contest ends. The official site takes a few days to declare contest results, so you can get an idea of your performance here before that. Head over to this [link](https://numbart.github.io/leetcode-predictor-frontend/) to view your changes for the last contest.
